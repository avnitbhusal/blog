Once upon a time, in a country far, far away, there was a small village at the base of a mountain. This village was called Tenby. The town had lived peacefully until one fateful day. 

One day, a fellow fisherman from the town was fishing in the stream that came down from the mountain. While fishing, he saw that there were far fewer fish than usual. This seemed strange because the stream would always be full of fish, and he had caught no fish in the span of two hours. So, he decided to go to the chief of the village and tell him this. If it turned out the fish had migrated it would be a very bad thing for Tenby. Tenby relied heavily on fish, as it was their main source of food, and they could trade it to foreigners. 

The fisherman packed up his things and went on to the town hall, where Chief Gonbar could almost always be found. He looked around and found Smilsun, the Chief’s clever assistant. He was sitting with many papers on his desk. 

“Hello, Smilsun! May I please have a quick word with the Chief?” the fisherman asked.

“Well, seeing that he isn’t busy right now, I suppose that would be fine. May I have your name, please?” Smilsun said.

    “I’m Jotun, a fisherman,” he replied.

    “All right Jotun, the Chief’s in that room,” Smilsun pointed to two fancy doors.

    Jotun walked over to the doors and knocked. He heard a voice say “Come in,” so he opened the door. He saw Chief Gonbar looking at some maps of Tenby. He had a white beard and white hair. The Chief was about 70 years old by then. 

    “What is it, my dear citizen?” Gonbar kindly asked.

    “Chief, I was out fishing in the stream and noticed significantly less fish than before. A week ago, I would have caught twenty fish in an hour, but now, I’ve caught no fish in two hours. And I’m sure it’s not just my luck. It seems the fish have migrated somewhere, and that would be bad for us. Our farms don’t provide enough for the whole village, and not to mention that we would have nothing to trade with. “ explained Jotun. 

    “You bring me troubling news. If the fish migrated then we would be in trouble. Less food for everybody, and no trading would mean we wouldn’t be able to sustain the village much longer. I agree the fish could have migrated, but we should check if there are more fish higher up. I will assign a group of explorers to this mission. You can rest assured that I will do everything I can to find out what happened.” said the Chief.
