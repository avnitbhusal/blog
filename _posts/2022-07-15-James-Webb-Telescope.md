The James Webb Space Telescope is the largest and most powerful space telescope ever built. It was designed to conduct infrared astronomy. It is about as big as a tennis court and tall as a three-story building. Webb has captured stunning images of galaxy clusters, nebulas, and exoplanets. Webb can not only take pictures of faraway galaxies but also of planets in our solar system. Webb sees the world in a different type of light called infrared radiation, which lets it see through dust clouds and makes things look beautiful. 

Webb has a huge honeycomb-like mirror that is gold-plated. It consists of eighteen small mirrors that fit together when unfolded. It is also above a sun shield that blocks heat from the sun so that the components don't overheat and break. Light takes time to travel from place to place, even if it's a small amount of time. However, the bigger the distance is, the longer it takes time to travel that distance. For example, it takes light about eight minutes to travel from the sun to the earth. So, when we are viewing the sun in the present, it is the sun from eight minutes ago. If the sun were suddenly out, then we wouldn’t notice until after eight minutes. The same goes for the galaxies that Webb is viewing. 

For example, in the image of SMACS 0723, we are seeing light from approximately 13 billion years ago. So, we are seeing this galaxy cluster how it was before even the earth was made! The James Webb telescope can see objects up to 100 million years after the Big Bang, which is an extremely long time ago. Webb can see things that are very far away. For example, it can see a penny that is 24 miles or 40 kilometers away. 

NASA calls the JWST a successor for Hubble. The JWST is 100 times more powerful than the Hubble Space Telescope. Hubble is also close to earth’s orbit while James Webb is about 1.5 million miles away from earth. Hubble is also repaired by astronauts in space because it is in earth's orbit. However, Webb cannot be repaired because it is so far away. So, if Webb is hit by an asteroid or in some way damaged, then we will not be able to fix it. Webb cost about 10 billion U.S. dollars to build.

When the telescope was launched on December 25, 2021, it was folded up so that it could fit in a rocket. When it reached its final position, it unfolded into a fully functioning form. The James Webb telescope might be able to detect traces of life on other planets.
